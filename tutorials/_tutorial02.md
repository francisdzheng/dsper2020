## K-Nearest Neighbors Classification

### Importing Libraries

As usual, we will want to use `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplot` to help us manipulate and visualize our data. 

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Additionally, we will want to use `Scikit-Learn` to apply the KNN algorithm on our data set. This is the beauty of libraries such as `Scikit-Learn`; we do not have to worry about the details of the algorithm's implementation. 

### Our Data Set
For examples of KNN, the [iris data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) from the University of California, Irvine is often used.
